## Assignment 1
Background info

Explore the data collected in class to study the relationship between the forearm length and the height of adults.

Tasks ofinterest
* Explore the data and specify the explanatory and response variable.
* Given plots to overview the data and decide on its normality.
* Remove outlier and fit the data with a linear regression model.
* Interpret the estimates of regression paramaters and identify the lurking variable.
* Indentify other possible variables for the linear regression model.

Data obtained
* The forearm length and height measurements in centimeters of 9 or 10 or 11 adults of the class.

Please see rmd and/or pdf under the folder submission work for more report and analysis details.

## Assignment 2
Background info

Prices for detached houses have been at an all-time high during the COVID-19 period and it is of the public's interest to establish a simple linear model that home buyers can use to determine the expected sale price of detached-house in Toronro and Mississauga.

Tasks ofinterest
* Plot the data and two scatterplots about list price and taxes.
* Carry out three linear regressions for sale price from list price, one for all data, one for Mississauga and one for Toronto.
* Intepret the estimate of intercept, slope and R square, discuss the significance of the model.
* Indentify the potiential violations against the SLR assumptions.

Data obtained
* Toronto Real Estate Board(TREB)
